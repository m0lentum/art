This repo contains the source code of my artworks
that feature real-time computer graphics.
For art that is just drawings and no code,
see [the gallery on my website](https://molentum.me/gallery).

Artworks in reverse chronological order:

### Don't forget to charge your moon staff

```
cargo run --bin moonstaff
```

![
A woman in a long blue dress standing on a mountain cliff,
surrounded by clouds and lit by a crescent moon.
She has two pairs of wings on her back and points a staff towards the moon.
Glowing particles stream from the moon to the staff.

First artwork made using my game engine [Starframe](https://github.com/m0lentum/starframe).

### Demodemonini

```bash
cargo run --bin demodemonini
```

![Three demonic creatures standing against a background of pixelated fire.
A small imp in a hoodie holding a keyboard,
a gorilla-shaped creature with mechanical arm and a CRT television for a head,
and a horned woman with RGB-lit bat wings wearing VR goggles and a Power Glove.
Everything is viewed through a distorted filter with a stripey CRT effect and chromatic aberration.
