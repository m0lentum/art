![Three demonic creatures standing against a background of pixelated fire.
A small imp in a hoodie holding a keyboard,
a gorilla-shaped creature with mechanical arm and a CRT television for a head,
and a horned woman with RGB-lit bat wings wearing VR goggles and a Power Glove.
Everything is viewed through a distorted filter with a stripey CRT effect and chromatic aberration.
